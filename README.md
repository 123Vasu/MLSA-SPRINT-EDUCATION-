# <u> `Problem Statement` :mag: </u>

***Every student has a passion towards observing the surroundings and pen down their thoughts in form of eassays,poems reports etc. Due to lack to proper guidance and the inability of getting someone rate their written works, these students are unable of understand their true potential. It becomes difficult of the teachers as well to grade and provide feedback to the students instanly.It becomes a tedious task for both and due to this circumstances we lose a great novelist or a remarkable poet.Our team understood this issue and tried to solve this through the power of Machine Learning.***
