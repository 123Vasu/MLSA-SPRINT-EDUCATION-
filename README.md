###  ***This project is a **'SOCIAL IMPACT PROJECT'** on the topic - *Education*. This is our sincere effort to help students to improve their writing proficiency and equip them with the confidence to show their creativity and write masterpieces.***

# <u> `Problem Statement ` :mag: </u>

**Every student has a keen interest in observing their surroundings and penning down their thoughts in form of essays, poem reports or any written assignment. Due to a lack of proper guidance and the inability of getting someone to rate their written works, these students are unable to understand their true potential. It becomes difficult for the educators as well to grade and provide feedback to the students instantly. It becomes a tedious task for both and due to these circumstances, we lose a great novelist or a remarkable poet.There are no such grading models that compare writing skills to a large amount of data available. Our team understood this issue and tried to solve this with the power of Machine Learning.**

# <u> `Project Overview` :star2: </u>

**Our project is Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for automated grading. We have done web scrapping using Python in order to harvest the data required The NLP algorithms automatically grade the student's essays, reports and other written assignments. Students can get instant validation and grades on their work and are able to understand their weak points without waiting for anyone to invest their time in checking their work.This also saves the time and effort of the educators and helps them to provide prompt feedback to the students. In this way, students can improve their writing skills at a fast pace without the constraints of waiting for validation.**

`P.s. We have made a constant companion for the students, who will validate their work without any complaints!`
