###  ***This project is a **'SOCIAL IMPACT PROJECT'** on the topic of - *Education*. This is our sincere effort to help educational institutions by providing them with a tool to track and analyse the attendance of the students in a hassle-free way.***

# <u> `Problem Statement ` :mag: </u>

**As students, we all are on high alert during the attendance waiting for the educator to call our name. This manual data entry for attendance takes 10-15 minutes of our valuable learning time still, there are certain inaccuracies in the data collected and it never tallies perfectly with your actual attendance record.Educators can't catch the ones giving proxy attendance for their best friends.Moreover, such big files are really hard to manage and it's a burden on the educators to analyse that written data and keep the records of every student. We believe technology should reach every level of the education system to make it more fluid. Our team understood this issue and tried to solve it with this python application.**

# <u> `Project Overview` :star2: </u>

**Our project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System based on Python which uses Opencv. It has many benefits over the traditional attendance systems that use ID cards or signatures. Face recognition technology is highly accurate and can identify individuals with a high level of precision. This means that there is less chance of errors in the attendance records. Some of the other benefits include -**<br>

**:sun_with_face: A face recognition attendance system can save a significant amount of time compared to manual systems. It can quickly capture attendance data and process  it automatically, without requiring any manual intervention.**<br>

**:sun_with_face: It is more secure than traditional systems that rely on ID cards or signatures. It is much harder for someone to impersonate another person or cheat the system, as face recognition technology can detect such attempts.**

`P.s. We have made a smart tool which will keep the students on the right 'attendance' track!`

# <u> `How it Works` ðŸ’¡</u>

**Our face recognition application basically works in two phases -** <br>

**:seedling: The registration phase - Each student needs to enter his/her name and unique ID and press the 'Add New User' button. The camera module turns on and captures the face of the student and saves it in the database along with the name and ID. For each student, 49 pictures are captured by the camera module so that no erroneous attendance is recorded.**<br>

**:seedling: Once the registration phase is over, the system gets fully trained to take attendance. Each student present just needs to sit in front of the camera module and press the 'Take Attendance' button. The camera module searches for the student's face in the stored database and reflects the attendance with the name, ID and time in less than 5 seconds.**

# <u> `Trial Session #1` :</u>

**We tried our application with few of our classmates and here are some images of the same -**<br>

**Registration phase -**<br>

**First student registers her name and ID :**<br>
![1st Student](https://github.com/123Vasu/MLSA-SPRINT-EDUCATION-02/blob/main/doel.png)
`Database shows 1 when the second student fills up his details`<br>
![2nd Student](https://github.com/123Vasu/MLSA-SPRINT-EDUCATION-02/blob/main/achint.png)
`Database counts upto 2`<br>
**This goes on until all the students register themselves in the system. Here we have done this trial only on four students.**<br>

**Attendance Time!**

**Each student sits in front of the camera module one by one and within few seconds his/her attendance is reflected.**<br>
