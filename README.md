###  ***This project is a **'SOCIAL IMPACT PROJECT'** on the topic of - *Education*. This is our sincere effort to help educational institutions by providing them with a tool to track and analyse the attendance of the students in a hassle-free way.***

# <u> `Problem Statement ` :mag: </u>

**As students, we all are on high alert during the attendance waiting for the educator to call our name. This manual data entry for attendance takes 10-15 minutes of our valuable learning time still, there are certain inaccuracies in the data collected and it never tallies perfectly with your actual attendance record.Educators can't catch the ones giving proxy attendance for their best friends.Moreover, such big files are really hard to manage and it's a burden on the educators to analyse that written data and keep the records of every student. We believe technology should reach every level of the education system to make it more fluid. Our team understood this issue and tried to solve this with the power of Machine Learning.**

# <u> `Project Overview` :star2: </u>

**Our project is Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for automated grading. We have done web scrapping using Python in order to harvest the data required The NLP algorithms automatically grade the student's essays, reports and other written assignments. Students can get instant validation and grades on their work and are able to understand their weak points without waiting for anyone to invest their time in checking their work.This also saves the time and effort of the educators and helps them to provide prompt feedback to the students. In this way, students can improve their writing skills at a fast pace without the constraints of waiting for validation.**

`P.s. We have made a constant companion for the students, who will validate their work without any complaints!`
